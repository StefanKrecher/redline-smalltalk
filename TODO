Modify preprocessor and grammar to remove '_class_' and make it just 'class'.

Remove instanceof checks by making a subclass of each node (this may not work out
well since a higher level will then be used to access the subnode with type erasure).


Change to Smalltalk.instance are an improvement, but also highlight a problem with
being able to use proper class loader. When Class A needs a smalltalk instance it
should ask the class for it's class loader and use that as Smalltalk instance.
*NOTE* until this change is made, two apps with see each others changes to a class.
Not what we want.


Boostrapper could be made more DRY.

Implement mehanism during doesNotUnderstand to turn bootstrapped classes into
proper classes.

Optimise the calls to Smalltalk.instance() so they are done once per method
or set of statements.

Change runtime exception when selector not understood with send of DNU.

Add command line parameter to turn on/off tracing.

Add command line parameter to indicate where source files can be found.
This path will be subtracted from the path of input source files to form
the class name. eg: src/test/smalltalk/Test.st with a source file path of
'src/test/' will be seen as the Class Test in the namespace 'smalltalk'

Refactor class loading / resolving functionality out of Smalltalk class.
