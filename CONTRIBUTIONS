----------
Maven + Eclipse support
Source code is now generated to /src/main/generated-sources so you don't need a dependency to the jar-File in target/redline-deploy
(you only need to deal with deal with maven-dependencies and  have no error-markers in eclipse anymore

Resolved some platform-specific issues
running redline in an windows-environment caused errors related to path separators ("\" vs. "/"). 
There were also some bugs in the classloader, regarding package-naming
